		<p><big><strong>HGTector ver 0.1.7 Quick Start Guide</strong></big></p>
		<p>Qiyun Zhu, Katharina Dittmar</p>
		<hr>
		<p><strong>Checklist</strong></p>
		<p><b>Operating system</b>: HGTector is cross-platform. It runs on <b>Windows</b>, <b>Mac OS X</b> and <b>Linux</b>. It may also run on other operating systems.</p>
		<p><b>Perl</b>: HGTector is written in <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>. It requires that you have a Perl interpreter installed in your system. The Perl interpreter is a standard component in most Mac OS X and Linux distributions. If you are a Windows user and you haven't installed it, you may download and install <a href="http://strawberryperl.com/">Strawberry Perl</a> or <a href="http://www.activestate.com/activeperl">ActivePerl</a>.
		<p><b>R</b>: <u>Optionally</u>, HGTector calls R to perform some advanced statistics and graphics. If you want to use these functions, you may install <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, as well as Perl package <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~fangly/Statistics-R-0.31/lib/Statistics/R.pm">Statistics::R</a>. Please refer to the <a href="manual.html">manual</a> for instructions.</p>
		
		
		<hr>
		<p><strong>Input files</strong></p>
		<p>HGTector takes one or more protein sets (from one or more genomes) as input.
		<p>You can download whole genome annotation files: browse <a href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/">NCBI genome database</a>, find genomes of your interest, and download the corresponding *.gbk files (GenBank format).
		<p><img src="images/qs_01.png" alt="Download genomes from NCBI database" width="542" height="557.5"></p>
		<p>Or, you can download lists of protein records: search keywords in <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein">NCBI protein database</a>, click "Send to:" - "File" - "Create File".</p>
		<p><img src="images/qs_02.png" alt="Download protein records from NCBI database" width="556" height="442.7"></p>
		<p>Or, you can prepare lists of protein accession numbers by yourself:</p>
		<p><img src="images/qs_03.png" alt="Prepare protein accession number lists" width="411.3" height="323.3"></p>
		<p>Create a folder to hold all input, intermediate and output files. This folder is your <b>working directory</b>.</p>
		<p>In the working directory, create a folder named "<b>input</b>", place the input files inside this folder. You may rename them with brief and meaningful names.<br>Note: the fold name "input" is case sensitive. Same below.</p>
		<p><img src="images/qs_04.png" alt="Create working directory" width="509.3" height="504.7"></p>
		<hr>
		<p><strong>Configuring HGTector</strong></p>
		<p>The parameters of HGTector is control by a configuration file named "<b>config.txt</b> in the working directory. This file can be generated using the <a href="../GUI.html">GUI</a>, or you can manually create your own based on the <a href="../config.txt">template</a>. If this file is omitted, the default parameters (as the template lists) will be used.
		<p><img src="images/qs_05.png" alt="Create configuration file" width="502" height="477.3"></p>
		<p>Both the GUI and the template explain the parameters and their possible values in detail. You can go through them to get an idea what they do.</p>
		
		
		<hr>
		<p><strong>Running HGTector</strong></p>
		<p>Despite having a <a href="../GUI.html">GUI</a> to generate config.txt, the HGTector program <a href="../HGTector.pl">itself</a> is written in Perl and only runs in <b>terminal</b> (command line mode). To launch terminal, you should:<p>
		<div class="indent">
			<p><b>Windows</b> users: press Win+R, type "cmd", and click "OK".</p>
			<p><b>Mac OS X</b> users: navigate to "Applications/Utilities", find "Terminal", and double-click on it.</p>
			<p><b>Unix/Linux</b> users: you know what to do.</p>
		</div>
		<p>Navigate to HGTector's <a href="..">program directory</a> using command <code>cd</code>. For example, if the program folder "HGTector" is placed on your desktop, then you may sequentially run these commands:</p>
		<blockquote><code>cd Desktop<br>cd HGTector</code></blockquote>
		<p>Run <a href="../HGTector.pl">HGTector</a> by typing:
		<blockquote><code>perl HGTector.pl path_to_the_working_directory</code></blockquote>
		<p>If you are not familiar with paths and directories, you may place the working directory (say, "mytask") in the HGTector folder, and simply run:
		<blockquote><code>perl HGTector.pl mytask</code></blockquote>
		<p>The program will now start to run through the whole process. There will be screen prompts to indicate any ongoing steps. You may keep pressing <code>Enter</code> (interactive mode) or simply wait (automatic mode) until you see the final result.</p>
		<p><img src="images/qs_06.png" alt="Run HGTector" width="496.7" height="457.3"></p>
		<p>The whole process contains five steps: <b>Blaster</b>, <b>Taxonomer</b>, <b>Purifier</b>, <b>Analyzer</b> and <b>Summarizer</b>. It is recommended to run one step, observe the output, and then run the next step. To run an individual step (say, Blaster), type:</p>
		<blockquote><code>perl HGTector.pl mytask -Blaster</code></blockquote>
		<p>You may repeatedly run one step until you are satisfied with the output. The new output will overwrite the old ones.</p>
		
		
		<hr>
		<p id="blaster"><strong>Step 1: Blaster</strong></p>
		<p>This step performs all-against-all BLASTP of input proteins in batch mode.</p>
		<p>You may either perform BLAST via http connection to the NCBI BLAST server (by default), or use standalone BLAST program on local BLAST databases, in which case, you need to download and install them. Please refer to this <a href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download">page</a> for instructions.</p>
		<p>The most important parameter at this step is the "number of hits to return" (<code>nHit</code>). It should allow sufficient sampling of BLAST hits for the genes. For single cellular eukaryotes, 100 hits may be enough; for most bacteria and archaea, 250-500 hits are recommended; for bacteria whose sister groups have been extensively sequenced (e.g., 500 <i>E. coli</i> genomes...), you may need more hits.</p>
		<p>When the task starts, the status of individual BLAST searches will be displayed on screen. If multiple Blaster instances are running simultaneously, the ongoing Blaster instances and the number of completed BLASTs will be updated every ten minutes.</p>
		<p><img src="images/qs_07.png" alt="Blaster screen output" width="402.7" height="270"></p>
		<p>A "blast" folder will be created in the working directory. The folder will contain subfolders representing individual protein sets, and log files recording the status of individual BLAST searches. The BLAST results of individual proteins will be stored in the subfolders.</p>
		<p><img src="images/qs_08.png" alt="Blaster results" width="472" height="507.3"></p>
		<p>The BLAST results are saved in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_file">NEXUS</a>-like format (*.bla). It contains a basic information section, and a BLAST hit table section.</p>
		<p>If you have switched on the "TaxBLAST" option (<code>taxBlast=1</code>), there will be an additional section, displaying the taxonomic tree of hits in an easy-to-read manner:</p>

		<p>If you have switched on the "Retrieve sequences" (<code>seqBlast=1</code>) or "Retrieve multiple sequence alignments" (<code>alnBlast=1</code>) option, an additional section will store the sequences of hits in NEXUS format. Therefore, the whole file can be directly opened by sequence-editing programs, such as <a href="http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/seaview.html">SeaView</a>.</p>
		<p><img src="images/qs_09.png" alt="Sequences of hits" width="528" height="352.7"></p>
		<p>Be prepared that the BLAST results may consume a considerable amount of disk spaces (typically hundred of MB to several GB).
		<p>The batch BLASTP process may take hours to days, depending on the size of input protein sets. It can be halted at any time (accidentally or intentionally). A halted task can be resumed at any time by re-executing this step.</p>


		<hr>
		<p><strong>Step 2: Taxonomer</strong></p>
		<p>This step retrieves taxonomic information of all BLAST matches from the NCBI server. The information includes names and TaxIDs of designated taxonomic ranks. The process typically lasts for several to dozens of minutes.</p>
		<p><img src="images/qs_10.png" alt="Running taxonomer" width="402.7" height="270"></p>
		<p>The result will be saved as three files: "taxa.db", "ranks.db" and "self.info" in a folder named "taxonomy" in the working directory.</p>
		
		
		<hr>
		<p><strong>Step 3: Purifier</strong></p>
		<p>This step is optional. It performs post-BLAST modifications to the BLAST reports. It includes a complete phylogenetics pipeline, which allows you to automatically build trees based on BLAST hits for each protein.</p>
		<p><img src="images/qs_11.png" alt="Running purifier" width="402.7" height="270"></p>
		<p>The resulting trees will be attached to each BLAST report in NEXUS format, too. Tip labels will be automatically translated into organism names. Therefore, the whole file can be directly viewed by tree-viewing programs, such as <a href="http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/">FigTree</a>.</p>
		<p><img src="images/qs_12.png" alt="Tree of hits" width="513" height="398.5"></p>
		<p>The amount of time this step takes varies, from 0 (if you skip this step) to weeks (if you want to build 10,000 deliberate maximum likelihood trees).</p>
		<p>The sequence alignments and trees will not be used for subsequent analyses. They are just for you to verify prediction results, either by eyeballing the trees or by conducting further analyses of your preference.</p>


		<hr>
		<p><strong>Step 4: Analyzer</strong></p>
		<p>This is the most important step of HGTector. It does all statistical tricks to find out which genes may be HGT-derived. All the intermediate and final results will be saved in folder "result".</p>
		<p>You may run this step for several times with different parameters until you get a satisfying result. (You don't have to re-run the previous three steps.)</p>
		<p>First, you need to specify a grouping scenario, which defines the <b><i>self</b></i>, <b><i>close</b></i> and <b><i>distal</b></i> groups of organisms.<p>
		<p><img src="images/qs_13.png" alt="Input grouping scenario" width="548.7" height="188"></p>
		<p>In brief, the <i>self</i> group contains all input genomes, and their immediate sister organisms. The <i>close</i> group contains sister groups of the <i>self</i> group, representing its vertical inheritance history. The <i>distal</i> group contains all other organisms, which are phylogenetically distant from the <i>self</i> group.</p>
		<p>For example, if you are studying several human genomes, you may consider defining the <i>self</i> group as all humans (genus <i>Homo</i>, TaxID = 9605), the <i>close</i> group as all great apes (family Hominidae, TaxID = 9604) (except for humans), and the <i>distal</i> group as everything else.</p>
		<p>Only gene flows from the <i>distal</i> group organisms to input genomes will be considered as putative HGT events.</p>
		<p><img src="images/qs_14.png" alt="Analyze grouping scenario" width="402.7" height="270"></p>
		<p>With a grouping scenario, the program will calculate the weight of BLAST hits of each group for each gene. For the whole genome(s), you will get three weight populations. They are defined as a "<b>fingerprint</b>" of the genome(s).</p>
		<p><img src="images/qs_15.png" alt="Read BLAST reports" width="402.7" height="270"></p>
		<p>The raw data (including three weights per gene) are saved as "rawdata.txt" in "result/statistics/". If you are familiar with statistics, you are encouraged to play with the data by yourself.</p>

		<p>If you have R installed, you may choose to graph the fingerprint (<code>graphFp=1</code>) as boxplot, histogram, density plot, and/or scatter plot. Here is an example:</p>
		<p><img src="images/qs_16.png" alt="Graphing fingerprints" width="531" height="269"></p>
		<p>Based on the fingerprint, the program will conduct cluster analyses to isolate a subset of genes that are significantly more likely to be horizontally acquired, comparing to the rest of the genome(s).</p>
		<p><img src="images/qs_17.png" alt="Cluster analyses" width="548.7" height="256"></p>
		<p>The results will be saved as tab-delimited text files in "result/detail/". Genes predicted to be HGT-derived will have a "1" in the "HGT" column.</p>
		<p>As an alternative to this proposed new method, you may also conduct the conventional "bidirectional best match" method to predict HGT events, by switch on option <code>BBH=1</code>.</p>
		<p>The whole step typically spends several minutes only.</p>
		
		
		<hr>
		<p><strong>Step 5: Summarizer</strong></p>
		<p>Now that you have the prediction results, it is time to summarize them in a human-readable manner. This step does the job. It generates reports in your choice of plain text, web page (HTML) and/or Excel spreadsheet formats.</p>
		<p><img src="images/qs_18.png" alt="HTML report" width="539.3" height="506.7"></p>
		<p>You have options to have the program summarize HGT-derived genes in three contexts: by putative donor group, by functional annotation, or by gene orthology.</p>
