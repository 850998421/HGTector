  ## Grouping scenario ##

    # Option 1: define the 'self' rank
      # All organisms within the same rank as the input genomes are considered as 'self'.
      # Meanwhile, all organisms (except for 'self' organisms) within the same one-level-up
      # rank are considered as 'close'. All other organisms are defined as 'distal'.
    selfRank=0

      # Here is an example: assume the input is some Escherichia genomes, then:
      # selfRank=genus        # genus level (Escherichia)
      # selfRank=family       # family level (Enterobacteriaceae)
      # selfRank=0            # the lowest rank that includes all input genomes (Escherichia)
      # selfRank=1            # the second lowest rank (Enterobacteriaceae)
    
    # Option 2: manually specify TaxID(s) for each group
      # TaxIDs can be looked-up in NCBI taxonomy database. They don't have to be limited to
      # taxonomic ranks defined by 'ranks'.
      # If there are multiple TaxIDs, separate them with commas.
      # Will override option 1.

  ## Sampling method ##

  ## (IMPORTANT) Cutoffs determination ##

      # 0: user-specified global cutoff
      # 1: user-specified individual cutoffs
      # 2: wait for user to type individual cutoffs
      # 3: draw histogram and isolate the first peak
      # 4: perform kernel density estimation and isolate the first peak
      # 5: (requires R) perform hierarchical clustering and isolate the first cluster
    howCO=4

    # User-specified global cutoff (defaults to 0.25, or the first quartile)
      # It applies to all three groups if howCO = 0.
      # It also applies to individual groups if other chosen approaches fail to determine cutoffs for
      # these particular groups.
    globalCO=0.25

    # User-specified cutoffs for individual groups
      # It is an absolute value, rather than a quantile.
      # For example, "1.35" means that values <= 1.35 are odd.
